# Course Planner App (April 2024)

This is a reupload of a project I completed while working on my Bachelor's degree. This project is a course planner for students to use throughout the semester. It keeps track of what classes they are taking, the different assignments, projects, and exams they are assigned, and the deadlines for each. It also has the ability to generate reports on the student's late work, giving them an idea of how many assignments they've submitted past due.

This project was built using .NET MAUI and C#. Student course data is stored in a local SQLite database. There is also a push-notification feature that alerts the student when an assignment is due soon. This project was built to run on both windows and android devices.

During development, this project was tracked using GitLabs through my university's account. I have renamed the project files and reuploaded them to here for better clarity & ease of access.

Included is the navigation design document, the entity-relationship diagram, and the application's solution files.
